The Royal Family Prince William is a member of the British royal family. He’s the Queen’s grandson and the eldest son of Charles and Diana. His brother’s name is Harry. Diana, their mother, isn’t alive now, but they have a stepmother, Camilla. William’s wife is Kate Middleton. She’s originally from an ordinary family but of course, she’s now the Duchess of Cambridge and part of the royal family. Kate has a brother, James, and a sister, Pippa. Their parents, Michael and Carole, have an online business. In some ways, Kate and William are a normal couple. They have friends from university and they have hobbies and interests too. For example, William loves football and Kate likes photography. In the winter, they go skiing together. In other ways, their lives are very different from their friends’ lives. William is the future King of the United Kingdom and fifteen other countries too, including Canada and Australia. Kate and William have a lot of official duties. They help charities in the UK and Africa, they visit other countries and they meet important visitors to the UK. The Duchess of Cambridge is expecting a baby, St James’s Palace has confirmed. All the members of the royal family and the Duchess’s family, the Middletons, are delighted: “The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall and Prince Harry and members of both families are delighted with the news.” The baby will be third in line to the throne, after Prince Charles and Prince William. A spokesman said the Duchess has been admitted to King Edward VII Hospital in central London with acute morning sickness and is expected to stay for several days: “As the pregnancy is in its very early stages, her royal highness is expected to stay in hospital for several days and will require a period of rest thereafter.” 6. Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, says he and his wife “could not be happier” after the Duchess gave birth to a baby boy, at 16:30, 22nd July 2013 UK time at St Mary’s Hospital, west London. William was present at St Mary’s for the birth. The young parents spent time with their son before telling the news to their families and the world. The Queen’s gynecologist Marcus Setchell, who led the team that delivered the baby, described the new arrival as “wonderful baby, beautiful baby”. A bulletin signed by him was taken by a royal aide from St Mary’s to the palace under police escort. The news has been since displayed on an easel in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace in line with tradition. A palace spokesman said the names of the baby would be announced in due course. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh are delighted at the news.” Complete the following sentences using the phrases given below.
