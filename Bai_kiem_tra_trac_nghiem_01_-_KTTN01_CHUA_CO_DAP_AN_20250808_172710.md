> Mô tả câu hỏi Read the text and decide if the following statements are  T (TRUE) or F (FALSE) We’re Living Faster, But Are We Living Better? Not long ago people believed that in the future we would work less, have more free time, and be more relaxed. But sadly this has not happened. Today we work harder, work longer hours, and are more stressed than ten years ago. We walk faster, talk faster, and sleep less than previous generations. And although we are obsessed with machines which save us time, we have less free time than our parents and grandparents had. But what is this doing to our health? An American journalist James Gleick in a new book, Faster: the acceleration of just about everything , says that people who live in cities are suffering from ‘hurry sickness’ – we are always trying to do more things in less time. As a result, our lives are more stressful. He says that if we don’t slow down, we won’t live as long as our parents. For most people, faster doesn’t mean better. 1 No time for the news Newspaper articles today are shorter and the headlines are bigger. Most people don’t have enough time to read the articles, they only read the headlines! On TV and the radio, newsreaders speak more quickly than ten years ago. 2 No time for stories In the USA there is a book called One-Minute Bedtime Stories for children. These are shorter versions of traditional stories, specially written for ‘busy parents’ who want to save time! 3 No time to listen Some answerphones now have ‘quick playback’ buttons so that we can re-play people’s messages faster – we can’t waste time listening to people speaking at normal speed. 4 No time to relax Even when we relax we do everything more quickly. Ten years ago when people went to art galleries they spent ten seconds looking at each picture. Today they spend just three seconds! 5 No time for slow sports In the USA the national sport, baseball, is not as popular as before it is a slow game and matches take a long time. Nowadays many people prefer faster and more dynamic sports like basketball. 6 ...but more time in our cars The only thing that is slower than before is the way we drive. Our cars are faster but the traffic is worse so we drive more slowly. We spend more time sitting in our cars, feeling stressed because we are worried that we won’t arrive on time. Experts predict that in ten years’ time the average speed on the road in cities will be 17 km/h. 1. ☐ The writer wrote the article to encourage us to work more and relax less. 2. ☐ People today are having a less stressful life than they did in the past. 3. ☐ People are too busy to read newspapers. 4. ☐ Slow sports have become unpopular. 5. ☐ More time is spent on stories.

> Text 1 Bad manners at work Etiquette is the name we give to the rules for being polite in a social group. Business etiquette is important for people who often have to make new contacts and build relationships in their work. Politeness can also help to improve the working environment for people in the same office. Some cultures and situations are formal, which means that we have to follow rules; other cultures and situations are more informal. Text 2 Office workers “admit being rude” Most office workers say they are rude or bad-mannered at work. Two out of three workers regularly arrive late for meetings, most ignore emails and three out of four use bad language. In a survey of 1,000 workers, two-thirds say that pressure of work is the reason for bad manners. Other common examples of bad office etiquette include ignoring colleagues and answering mobile phone calls during meetings. Using mobile phones in meetings is impolite and distracts others, research by the University of Surrey shows. If you respond to call when speaking to somebody, it means that the phone call is more important than the person, the survey said. If you answer a call during a meeting, it could mean that the meeting is not important. Mr Jacobs, managing director of Office Angels, a recruitment firm say it is easy for people to forget their manners in the working environment, which is often very informal and very busy. Workers can forget proper etiquette such as introducing people at meetings, and this is often bad for working relationships. Psychologist Dr Colin Gill believes that people are not as polite as they were twenty years ago. He said: ‘Courtesy is no longer something that is so much respected in our society.’ People think it is ‘stuffy to be polite or formal.’ Now some organisations are actually investing money in training their junior managers to be polite. Office Angels is encouraging people to arrive on time for meetings, turn off mobile phones and avoid bad manners at work is such a simple thing to do,’ Mr Jacobs says, ‘ and it can have a dramatic impact on improving your working environment and your relationships with others.’

#### Đáp án:
- [ ] a. spend all money they have
- [ ] b. improve the working environment and relationships with others
